# 🧠 Front-End Projects

This repository contains all of my front-end practice projects as I progress through my learning roadmap. Each project is organized in its own folder and includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with some projects using frameworks like React).

These projects are designed to help reinforce concepts such as responsive design, DOM manipulation, component-based architecture, and API integration.
